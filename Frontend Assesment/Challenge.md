- [Angular](https://angular.io/) version `13`


### The Challenge

- Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ and congrats on receiving this coding challenge.
- To complete this challenge, you need a good understanding of **HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript and Angular.**
- Your challenge is to build out a `task app` and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Your users should be able to:
    + See useable UI elements built with Angular Material.
    + Components should keep their ratio when scaling down to smaller screens using media queries.
    + See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
    + Add new tasks to the list.
    + Delete tasks from the list.
    + Clear all tasks.
    + Log the users public ip in the console.

- Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `./design` folder.
    + [Link to Design File](design/Nclose%20Front%20End.pdf)
- You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder.
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) documentation.
- Public IP API:
    + Perform a `get` on `https://api.ipify.org/?format=json` which should return a string.

## Building your project

Below is a defined process we expect you to follow:

- Follow the initial instructions in the root [README.md](../README.md#description) file.
- Look through the designs to start planning your component views and different states.
- Use Angular 13 specifically to build this project.
- When the app renders we expect to see our public ip logged in the console, use a service with a `getIP()` function to achieve this.
- Once complete commit your changes with your finish time/date in your readme file.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
